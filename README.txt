JumpJump is a small platformer game in which the player jumps from obstacle to obstacle to reach the target. The unique aspect of the game is that the character posseses a hook reel (spiderman-esque) to attach to entities and has the ability to drag themselves towards it. While it currently only features one level, there is a sandbox mode that allows the player to create as many levels as they would like with an interactive interface system.

To play, download the repository as a zip and open the 'JumpJumpv1.00.02.jar'.
