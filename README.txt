The video does not include the console because the recording program did not record it for some reason. It appears within the game (as you can try for yourself by pressing the '~" key...The recorded appears to only record one layer.

The maps.HACK and .MAP files must be in the same directory as the JAR file to run. These files are the map files that can be written within the game, so must remain outside the JAR file.
